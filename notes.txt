Scope and closures

lexical scope: scopes that can be detected during code reading (as you type)

if you dont use var, the var goes to global scope

execution scope/in memory scope: build as the code runs

Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables. In other words, the function defined in the closure 'remembers' the environment in which it was created.

Parameter this = obj.fn() --> every thing before the dot is what "this" is referring to
